HUGO Library Changes File
Maintained by Julian Arnold (jools@arnod.demon.co.uk)


This file details important differences between versions of the standard
Hugo library by Kent Tessmann (from v2.3.0 onwards).

Important differences are ones which fix bugs, add features, or
otherwise affect the functioning and/or functionality of the library.

Each release of the library also contains numerous small changes:
altered formatting, restructured code, additional or reworded comments,
and so on.  These differences will not be mentioned.

v2.3.1, for use with HC v2.3
________________________________________________________________________

1.
The output of the $di (audit directions) debugging verb from hugofix.h
has been tidied.

2.
The HoursMinutes routine in hugolib.h can now take an optional second
argument to specify military 24-hour time.  For example:
	HoursMinutes(847)      prints 2:07 p.m.
	HoursMinutes(847,true) prints 14:07

3.
The DoGo routine in hugolib.h now ensures object does not have a door_to
property, and is enterable, before passing control to the DoEnter
routine.

This fixes a bug to do with ENTERing or GOing to an `enterable' object
with a `door_to' property-- previously this would cause a stack
overflow, as DoGo and DoEnter would call each other endlessly.

4.
The component class, defined in objlib.h, now inherits from the scenery
class, also defined in oblib.h, and is part_of the nothing object by
default (previously it did not necessariy have the part_of property).

v2.3.2, for use with HC v2.3
________________________________________________________________________

hugofix.g	2,352		12:41:00 16 Apr 1997
hugofix.h	5,486		10:23:20 21 Apr 1997

verbstub.h	3,402		12:41:08 16 Apr 1997
________________________________________________________________________

5.
A new global, `player_person', has been added to hugolib.h.  This should
be set to either 1, 2, or 3 (2 is the default) to reflect whether
library messages (ie, those contained in routines Message in hugolib.h
and OMessages in objlib.h) are to be given in the first-, second-, or
third-person.  For example:
	VALUE	PERSONAL	EXAMPLE
		PRONOUN		MESSAGE
	---------------------------------------------------
	1	I		I already have that.
		we		We already have that.
	2	you (s.)	You already have that.
		you (pl.)	You already have that.
	3	he/she/it	He/she/it already has that.
		they		They already have that.

Being a global the value of `player_person' can be changed during play.

NOTE: Depending on the value of `player_person' the player object should
either have, or not have the `plural' attribute set (ie, `player is
[not] plural'):
	VALUE	PERSONAL	ATTRIBUTE
		PRONOUN
	--------------------------------------------
	1	I       	player is plural
		we		player is plural
	2	you (s.)	player is plural
		you (pl.)	player is plural
	3	he/she/it	player is not plural
		they		player is plural

NOTE: The `name' property of the player object should also reflect the
value of `player_person':
	VALUE	PERSONAL	NAME
		PRONOUN
	----------------------------------------------------------------
	1	I		player.name="I"
		we		player.name="we"
	2	you (s.)	player.name="you"
		you (pl.)	player.name="you"
	3	he/she/it	player.name="he"/"she"/"it" (or a proper
				noun, ie, "Bob")
		they		player.name="they" (or a proper noun,
				ie, "men of Harlech")

6.
The global `nest', declared in hugolib.h, has been renamed to
`list_nest', to better reflect its purpose (`list_nest' is used in
various library routines which print a list).

7.
The `extra_scenery' check (which checks the players input for words
listed in the current location's `extra_scenery' property) in routine
Parse in hugolib.h, now begins its checking at the second word of the
input (ie, `word[2]'), rather than the first.  This ensures that verb
words are not considered during this check.

8. (See also: 2.)
Routine HoursMinutes in hugolib.h previously had three bugs: a) midnight
in 12-hour format was printed as "0:00 a.m."--it is now "12:00 a.m."; b)
hours before noon in 24-hour format were printed as, ie, "5:00"--they
are now, ie, "05:00"; c) hours before noon in 24-hour format were still
suffixed with "a.m."--they no longer are.

9. (See also: 5.)
Routines The and Art in hugolib.h now take optional true-or-false second
arguments, which only take effect if the first argument is equal to
`player' and `player_person' equals 1.  In full:
	The(player)		prints "I"
	The(player, true)	prints "me"
	Art(player)		prints "I"
	Art(player, true)	prints "me"

10. (See also: 5, 9.)
If the first argument is equal to `player' and `player_person' equals 1
routine IsorAre in hugolib.h prints " am" or "'m" rather than " are" or
"'re".

11. (See also: 5, 9, 10.)
A new routine, MatchPlural, has been added to hugolib.h, as a
requirement of the new "player person" rules.  MatchPlural is called
with three arguments, <object>, <word1>, and <word2>.  It simply prints
<word1> if <object> is not `plural', or <word2> if <object> is `plural'. 
For example:
	print CThe(player); MatchPlural(player, "doesn't", "don't"); \
	" need to refer to that."

12.
Previously rooms were not being marked as `visited'.  Thus a full
description was given whenever the player entered a room, regardless of
`verbosity', and whether or not he had been there before.  This
behaviour has been fixed.

13.
Routine DoEnter in hugolib.h no longer allows the entering of objects in
the players inventory (response is "You can't enter that").

14. (See also: 5, 9, 10, 11.)
Routines Message in hugolib.h and OMessages in objlib.h updated to work
with the new "player person" rules.

15.
Object definitions for compass directions in objlib.h have been
re-ordered.  They are now defined, starting with north (`n_obj'),
clockwise around the compass.  Ie, `n_obj', `ne_obj', `e_obj', `se_obj',
etc.  Previously they were given in the (somewhat illogical) order
`n_obj', `s_obj', `e_obj', `w_obj', `ne_obj', `se_obj', `nw_obj',
`sw_obj'.

________________________________________________________________________

16.
The Window Class Library, window.h, has been added.  This defines a
class, `window_class', for use with the multiple window feature new to
v2.4.  Full instructions are contained in the file.

17.
Built-in properties for the engine-defined `display' object have been
enumerated in hugolib.h, and the library-specific `display' object
property, `statusline_height' (aliased with `n_to') has also been
declared, and given a default value of 1.

18.
The classes `female_character' and `component' no longer inherit from
`character' and `scenery', respectively, in objlib.h, as this was
causing problems with `replace <object>' code using non-precompiled
libraries.

19.
The Hugo Resource Library, resource.h, has been added.  This currently
contains two routines for loading and displaying graphics.  Full
instructions are contained in the file.

20.
Menu() in hugolib.h now takes an optional 3rd argument which specifies
the starting selection in the menu.

21.
CenterTitle() in hugolib.h now takes an optional 2nd argument which
determines the height of the window created by this routine.  If this
2nd argument is unspecified, or given as 0, it defaults to 1.

22.
DoGo() in hugolib.h now checks to see if the attempted move is to a door
object (ie, if the object is of the `door' class (defined in objlib.h)
or if the object has a door_to property).  If so, the direction in which
the move is being attempted is set to the return value of the object's
`door_to' property.

All this means that instead of, for example:
  n_to {
    return my_door.door_to
  }

it is now permissable to have:
  n_to my_door

23.
Most classes, as defined in objlib.h, no longer have specific `name'
properties.

24.
Various bugfixes have been made to window.h.
